## Chapter 1 Characterization of continuous images

### 1.1 Images as functions

#### 1.1.1 Continuous image representation

For continuous image (monochrome), the image can be represented as followed.

2D light intensity function: $$ f(x,y) $$
* spatial coordinates: $$(x,y)$$ x represents columns, y represents rows. (from left-top to right-down)
* brightness (or gray level): $$f\in[f_{min},f_{max}]$$

#### 1.1.2 Hilbert-space formulation

Hibert space is infinite-dimensional Euclidean space. Images can be considered as points in a Hilbert space $$\mathcal{H}$$

For 1D signals:

* Vectors of samples $$\mathbb{R}^N$$     $$u = (u_1,u_2,...,u_N)$$
* Discrete signals $$\ell_2(Z^2)$$    $$u = (...,u_0,u_1,...,u_k,...)$$
* Continuously-defined signals  $$L_2(\mathbb{R})$$   $$u = u(x), x \in \mathbb{R}$$

For 2D images:

* Finite array of pixels   $$\mathbb{R}^N$$
* Discrete images    $$\ell_2(Z^2)$$
* Continuous images   $$L_2(\mathbb{R})$$

The definition of a Hilbert space $$\mathcal{H}$$ is a complete vector space with an inner product.

$$\mathcal{H}$$-inner product: $$<u,v>$$

* Linearity: $$<a_1u+a_2v,w> = a_1<u,w>+a_2<u,w>, \forall a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}, \forall u, v, w \in \mathcal{H}$$
* Symmetry: $$<u,v>^* = <v, u >, \forall u,v \in H$$
* Positive definite: $$<u,v> > 0, \forall u \neq 0, u \in \mathcal{H}$$

Induced Norm

* $$|u| = <u,u>^{1/2}$$
