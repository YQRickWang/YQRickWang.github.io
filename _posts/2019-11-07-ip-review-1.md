## **Chapter 0 Introduction**
#### **What is image processing?**
Image processing is basically about **any manipulation of image-related data via a computer.** The definition of the image processing is **transformation of pictorial information.** Image Processing includes examples like enhancement, denoising, deblurring and 3D deconvolution.

Also, image analysis is about extraction of images features and quantitative information (measures). Examples like fluorescence micrograph, segmentation of nucleus and etc.

Image processing is an interdisciplinary field which involes a lot of subjects. And it has many applications in different reserach area.

In an image-analysis system, there are five levels which are from low to high.
* Image acquisition (pixels)
* Preprocessing or transform (pixels or coefficients)
* Segementation (features)
* Description, feature extraction (objects)
* Interpretation, recognition (decision)

#### **The basic objects: images**
In image processing, basic objects are images. There are three types of images: **continuous images, discrete images and generalized images.**

For continuous image (monochrome), the image can be represented as followed.

2D light intensity function: $$ f(x,y) $$
* spatial coordinates: $$(x,y)$$
* brightness (or gray level): $$f\in[f_{min},f_{max}]$$

In above case, **when the value of brightness is 0**, the color is **black**. When the value of brightness is $$f_{max}$$, the color is **white**.
